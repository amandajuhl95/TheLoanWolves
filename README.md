# The Loan Wolves
Made by Sofie Amalie Landt, Amanda Juhl Hansen & Benjamin Aizen Kongshaug

#### Project Description

Loan Wolves is a swedish cooperative bank. Seated in GÃ¶teborg. They would like to open a department in Denmark. Their IT system is outdated so they would like to make a new one for the Danish department. Both systems should have the same functionality but the new one should be improved with performance in mind. The Loan Wolves will offer the same loan types in Denmark as they do in Sweden. Therefore, the new IT system should have access to the loan types that the bank offers. The loan types are stored in csv file(s) and are updated daily, by the current IT system. Doing the last couple of years, The Loan Wolves have received an increasing amount of loan requests in other currencies than SEK, therefore they have created an internal service to convert the amounts from international currencies. This service is separated from their main system. The service is accessed through a REST Api and can be used by the Danish IT-system.

#### To make docker container for H2 database with volume in project folder run:

For LoginService 
<i>Go to: localhost:8081</i>
```
docker run --rm -v "[YOUR_PATH_TO_PROJECT_FOLDER]/TheLoanWolves/LoginService/data:/h2-data" --name h2-user -d -p 9091:9092 -p 8081:8082 buildo/h2database 
```
For LoanAmortizationService and LoanQuoteService 
<i>Go to: localhost:8083</i>
```
docker run --rm -v "[YOUR_PATH_TO_PROJECT_FOLDER]/TheLoanWolves/LoanAmortizationService/data:/h2-data" --name h2-loan -d -p 9093:9092 -p 8083:8082 buildo/h2database
```
For AccountService 
<i>Go to: localhost:8085</i>
```
docker run --rm -v "[YOUR_PATH_TO_PROJECT_FOLDER]/TheLoanWolves/AccountService/data:/h2-data" --name h2-account -d -p 9095:9092 -p 8085:8082 buildo/h2database 
```
For LoggingService 
<i>Go to: localhost:8087</i>
```
docker run --rm -v "[YOUR_PATH_TO_PROJECT_FOLDER]/TheLoanWolves/LoggingService/data:/h2-data" --name h2-logging -d -p 9097:9092 -p 8087:8082 buildo/h2database
```

#### To make docker container for Camunda, run:
```
docker pull camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```
```
docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
```
 
1. Go to [Camunda Dashboard](http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/cockpit/default/#/dashboard) to check tha Camunda is running. 

##### Login information

#### To make docker container for Kafka, run in the root of the downloaded project:
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-kafka/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
```
```
docker-compose up -d
```

1. Check in Docker that a container with a zookeeper and kafka is running. 
2. Next open OffSet Explorer 2 and add a connection to the created docker container.

#### Endpoints

- All endpoints requires that you are logged in (besides create user).
- When logged in an autogenerated token is returned, and this should be send as part of Request Headers {key:value}, within the following requests.
